# Plot Distance-Elevation GPX Information on a Background PDF with a Streamlit App

This is a small app to plot GPX distance-elevation data on a PDF.

To start the app, install the requirements:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Then, run the app by:
```
streamlit run main.py
```

In the App, just upload your background PDF and the corresponding GPX file, and tune
the plot settings. When you are done, just download the PDF.

The backend of the App works as a standalone Python package.
